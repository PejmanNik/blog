**Paprize** (Paper + Size) is a framework-agnostic report generation tool born from the lessons learned building **[Puppeteer-report](https://github.com/PejmanNik/puppeteer-report)** and [Jikji](https://github.com/PejmanNik/jikji). It allows you to design your report using the full power of JavaScript and CSS; simply mark your report sections using Paprize components, and the pagination engine will transform them into beautiful, professional, print-ready pages.
